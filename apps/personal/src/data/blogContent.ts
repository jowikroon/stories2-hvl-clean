Dark patterns are everywhere in e-commerce. From misleading countdown timers to hidden fees at checkout, these manipulative design tactics might boost short-term conversions — but at what cost?

## The Illusion of Success

When you trick users into clicking, subscribing, or purchasing, the numbers look good on a dashboard. But the reality underneath tells a different story:

- **Higher return rates** — users who feel deceived return products more often
- **Increased support tickets** — confusion breeds complaints
- **Brand erosion** — trust, once lost, is nearly impossible to rebuild
- **Regulatory risk** — the EU is actively cracking down on deceptive design

## What Works Instead

The most successful e-commerce brands I've worked with share a common trait: radical clarity. They make it easy to understand what you're buying, how much it costs, and what happens next.

### Transparent Pricing
Show the full price upfront. No hidden shipping fees, no surprise taxes at checkout. Amazon does this well with their "total before order" summary.

### Honest Urgency
If stock is genuinely low, say so. But fake scarcity ("Only 2 left!" when there are 200) destroys credibility with repeat customers.

### Easy Cancellation
Making it easy to leave makes people more likely to stay. This counterintuitive truth has been proven time and again in subscription businesses.

## The Bottom Line

Dark patterns are a tax on your future self. Every shortcut today creates a trust deficit tomorrow. Build for the long game.

Large language models are changing how we design digital products — but "just add AI" is a fast way to ship confusing, fragile experiences. Good LLM UX isn't a magic box; it's a set of deliberate choices about what the model should do, how confident it is, and how humans stay in control.

In this article I share a practical framework for designing LLM-powered products: how to define confidence boundaries, keep humans in the loop, design for failure instead of pretending it won't happen, and gradually reveal capabilities as users build trust.

## The Problem with "Just Add AI"

Most AI integrations I've seen fall into one of two traps:

1. **The Magic Box** — users don't understand what the AI can or can't do
2. **The Replacement** — AI replaces human workflows without considering what's lost

## A Framework for LLM-Powered UX

After working with several AI-powered products, I've developed a simple framework:

### 1. Define the Confidence Boundary
Every LLM response has a confidence level. Your UX should communicate this. High-confidence answers can be presented directly. Low-confidence ones should be presented as suggestions with easy override paths.

### 2. Keep Humans in the Loop
The best AI experiences augment human decision-making rather than replacing it. Think autocomplete, not autopilot.

### 3. Design for Failure
LLMs will hallucinate. Your UX needs graceful failure states. What happens when the AI gives a wrong answer? Users need an easy path to correct course.

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Don't dump all AI capabilities on users at once. Start with the most reliable, most useful features, and gradually introduce more complex ones.

## Looking Ahead

We're still in the early days of LLM-powered products. The teams that invest in thoughtful UX now will have a significant advantage as the technology matures.

  "cycling-dutch-countryside": `
There's something about cycling through the Dutch countryside that resets my brain. The flat horizon, the windmills, the endless green — it's meditation in motion.

## The Route

My favorite route starts in Amersfoort, heads east through the Gelderse Vallei, and loops back through small villages like Leusden and Woudenberg. About 45 kilometers, mostly flat, mostly quiet.

## What I Notice

When you're on a bike, you notice things you'd never see from a car. The way light changes across a field. The sound of wind through tall grass. The smell of rain approaching from the west.

## The Connection to Work

I've had some of my best ideas while cycling. There's research suggesting that low-level physical activity combined with changing scenery creates ideal conditions for creative thinking. The Dutch call it "uitwaaien" — to walk or cycle in the wind to clear your head.

## Slow Down to Speed Up

In a world optimized for speed and efficiency, sometimes the most productive thing you can do is slow down. Get on a bike. Look at the horizon. Let your mind wander.

The ideas will come.

  "cro-design-problem": `
Most companies approach conversion rate optimization like a science experiment: change the button color, run an A/B test, declare victory. But real CRO is fundamentally a design problem.

## Beyond A/B Testing Theater

A/B testing is a tool, not a strategy. I've seen teams run hundreds of tests without meaningfully improving their conversion rate because they were testing the wrong things.

The question isn't "Should the button be green or blue?" It's "Why aren't users clicking any button at all?"

## Understanding Intent

The most powerful CRO lever is understanding user intent. Why did someone come to your page? What are they trying to accomplish? What's preventing them from doing it?

### The Intent-Friction Framework

1. **Map user intent** — what do they want to achieve?
2. **Identify friction points** — what's stopping them?
3. **Reduce friction** — remove unnecessary steps, clarify confusing elements
4. **Validate with data** — measure the impact of your changes

## Design-First CRO in Practice

At Alpine Hearing Protection, we improved our Amazon conversion rate by focusing on the product detail page experience. Instead of testing button colors, we:

- Rewrote product descriptions to match search intent
- Reorganized images to answer common questions first  
- Added comparison tables for different product variants

The result? A meaningful lift in conversion that compounded over time.

## The Takeaway

Stop optimizing pixels. Start understanding people.

  "ai-search-ux-lessons": `
When we deployed AI-powered search to 2 million users, we learned that the technology was the easy part. The hard part was designing an experience that users actually trusted and used.

## The Setup

Our e-commerce platform had a traditional keyword search that was... fine. Users could find products, but the experience was frustrating for anything beyond exact product name matches.

## What We Built

We implemented a semantic search engine that understood natural language queries. Instead of matching keywords, it understood intent. "Something to protect my ears at a concert" would return relevant hearing protection products.

## The Surprises

### 1. Users Don't Trust Magic
When search results were too good, users got suspicious. They wondered if we were just showing them what we wanted to sell. We had to add transparency — showing why each result was relevant.

### 2. Speed Beats Accuracy
A slightly less accurate result delivered in 200ms outperformed a perfect result delivered in 2 seconds. Users interpreted speed as competence.

### 3. The Empty State Matters Most
What happens when AI search returns no results? This is where most implementations fail. We invested heavily in helpful empty states with suggestions and alternative queries.

## Key Metrics

- 35% increase in search-to-purchase conversion
- 20% reduction in search abandonment  
- 45% increase in average query length (users trusted the system with more complex queries)

## What I'd Do Differently

Start with the UX research, not the technology. We spent months building the search engine before talking to users. If we'd started with user research, we would have made different architectural decisions.

  "bookshelf-2024": `
Every year I try to read a mix of professional and personal books. Here's what shaped my thinking in 2024.

## Design & Technology

**"Refactoring UI" by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger** — The most practical design book I've ever read. Every page has actionable advice.

**"The Design of Everyday Things" by Don Norman** — A re-read, but it hits different after years of real-world design experience.

**"AI 2041" by Kai-Fu Lee & Chen Qiufan** — Science fiction meets AI prediction. Thought-provoking scenarios of how AI might reshape society.

## Business & Strategy

**"Working Backwards" by Colin Bryar & Bill Carr** — Inside Amazon's culture and decision-making. Invaluable for anyone working in e-commerce.

**"Amp It Up" by Frank Slootman** — Intense leadership philosophy. Not for everyone, but the core message about raising standards resonated.

## Fiction & Personal

**"Klara and the Sun" by Kazuo Ishiguro** — A beautiful, melancholic novel about AI and love. Made me think differently about what it means to observe and understand.

**"De Avonden" by Gerard Reve** — A Dutch classic I finally got around to reading. Bleak, funny, and strangely comforting.

## The Pattern

Looking at this list, I see a thread: observation. Every book I gravitated toward was about seeing the world more clearly — whether through design, data, or fiction.

  "ux-unit-economics": `
As UX designers, we love talking about user needs. But there's a language we often avoid: the language of business metrics. Understanding unit economics isn't selling out — it's leveling up.

## Why This Matters

Every design decision has a financial impact. When you reduce friction in a checkout flow, you're directly affecting revenue. When you design a feature that increases session time, you're influencing lifetime value.

If you can't articulate these impacts, someone else will make those decisions for you.

## The Metrics That Matter

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
How much does it cost to acquire a new customer? Your onboarding design directly affects this. A better onboarding experience = lower CAC through better conversion and word-of-mouth.

### Lifetime Value (LTV)
How much revenue does a customer generate over their lifetime? Your retention design — the features that keep people coming back — drives this number.

### The LTV:CAC Ratio
The golden ratio. Aim for 3:1 or higher. If your ratio is below 1:1, you're literally paying people to use your product.

## How to Talk About It

Instead of: "We should improve the onboarding flow because it's confusing."

Try: "Our onboarding completion rate is 45%. Improving it to 60% would reduce our effective CAC by 25%, generating an estimated €200K in annual savings."

Same recommendation. Vastly different impact in a boardroom.

## The Bottom Line

You don't need an MBA. You need to understand four or five key metrics and connect your design work to them. That's how you get a seat at the table.

  "sourdough-products": `
I started making sourdough during the pandemic, like everyone else. But unlike most people, I kept going. Three years later, my starter is still alive, and it's taught me more about product design than any book.

## The Parallel

Sourdough is an exercise in patience. You mix flour and water, and then you wait. You fold the dough, and then you wait. You shape it, and then you wait. The bread tells you when it's ready — you don't get to decide.

Product design works the same way. You can't rush good design. You iterate, you test, you listen to users, and you iterate again. The product tells you when it's ready.

## What Sourdough Taught Me

### 1. Environment Matters
Sourdough behaves differently in summer versus winter, in dry air versus humid air. Products behave differently in different contexts too. What works on desktop might fail on mobile. What works in the Netherlands might confuse users in Japan.

### 2. Small Changes Compound
Adjusting hydration by 2% changes everything about the bread. In products, small UX changes — a word here, a color there — compound into dramatically different experiences.

### 3. Failure Is Data
My first 20 loaves were terrible. But each failure taught me something. Each failed product feature teaches you something too, if you're paying attention.

### 4. Share the Result
The best part of baking is sharing. The best part of building products is watching people use them.

## The Recipe

70% bread flour, 20% whole wheat, 10% rye. 78% hydration. 20% levain. 2% salt. Bulk ferment 4-5 hours. Cold retard overnight. Bake at 250°C with steam.

Or, you know, just iterate until it tastes right.
